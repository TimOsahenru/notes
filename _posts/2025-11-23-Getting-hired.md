In the late quarter of 2022, the first email requesting me to apply for an internship position droped in my DMs, my first gig paid in foreign currency, I wasn’t surprised because I expected it, I felt it even took too long than expected, this sense of confidence came because I knew I had put in the work needed, so why some might interpret my fate as mere luck, although it is true, luck did contribute to my success, but also, I was prepared and in search of her(luck) by being deliberate about what I wanted and also by taking some actionable steps.

These deliberate steps to getting you your own first job or gig as a software engineer are what I will be sharing in this guide, I’m not promising you a similar outcome as mine, cos I believe yours might be a better process as to how I started and a better offer as to what I gained. What I am assuring you of is, if you put these steps to good use, you’ll see the results within a year.

### Tip1: Being intentional
> Intentional living is the art of making your own choices before other choices make you.
>

I had to be intentional about what part of tech I wanted to start building a career in and for me it was as a backend engineer; a backend engineer is mostly concerned about the flow of logic of an application.

I had researched some of the best languages to learn as far back as 2021 given my area of specialty and Python was top on that list, it still is as of {{ site.time | date: "%Y" }} according to [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/best-programming-languages-to-learn). It took me about 6 months to understand the concepts of Python.

When I was sure I understood what it’ll cost me to be proficient in Python as a backend engineer, I committed myself to it.


### Tip2: Commit yourself
> Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans. ― Peter F. Drucker.
>

Commitment is the decision to show up every day regardless of the amount of work, commitment is in the little steps you take each day towards your plan or goal, commitment is in knowing that consistency beats intensity any day or time, not focusing too much on the result of perfection but rather on the process of the journey.

So, on November 8, 2021, I decided to commit to my plan and strategy of getting my first paid gig as a Python developer.

[I made a Tweet then which isn't available anymore cos I've long left Twitter cos of the toxicity and nudity there]. You know, when the universe knows about your plan it finds a way it guides you unto completion, especially if you’re determined to see it through, the old book of wisdom says

>...Write the vision And make it plain on tablets, That he may run who reads it. 
>

This was the teaching I adhered to that inspired the said tweet mentioned above, making that tweet as a show of my commitment wasn’t the last bus stop, I had to also put in the work needed.

Before I started learning Python properly, I had to familiarize myself with the basics of programming again, so I signed up for a beginners course in computer science. I had to learn programming from scratch even tho I have a bachelors in computer science, I learnt these fundamentals for a couple of weeks (say about 4 weeks) on a free platform by [Harvard University](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home)

While many are meant to believe that tech is hard, the lack of a proper road map makes it even harder.

I proceeded to also learn the core concepts of other languages like c++ still under the same curriculum from [Harvard(cs50)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home), not sure how long this took but to follow a 6 months plan let's say two months because by February of the following year(2022) I had already narrowed my focus to just learning Python.

Once I understood the fundamentals of computer programming again, I now narrowed my learning with teachings from [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com/), Mosh’s teaching style is top-notch and very beginners friendly.

After understanding the core concepts of Python; variables, functions, classes, OOP, etc, I was still in search of more beginners guide to learn more about the programming language Python.


### Tip3: Document your journey
> Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination - Dwight D. Eisenhower
>

Documentation is the love language that you write to your future self, it is very important to document your journey as a software engineer, you will always be impressed by how much you have improved when you go back to visit your documentation.

Documenting your tech journey helps you better understand the concepts you are learning and also gives you room to improve on your skill sets as it exposes you to a community of expert engineers who will point out some loops for you to close in on and as well beginners who will benefit a lot from your experience, I’m still amazed at the number of engagement I get from people who say they benefit from my little wealth of knowledge.

I use my [GitHub account](https://github.com/TimOsahenru) constantly not only as a version control system but to also document my projects.

If Git/GitHub is a bit too techinical for you, you can use free resources like [dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) these resources are freely available for use. You don’t need to pay for a domain as a beginner to start documenting your ideas.

### Tip4: Effectively belong to a community
> Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much – Helen Keller
>

By May 2022, I searched for some Python handles to follow on Twitter and I stumbled on PyGhana, coincidentally they made a retweet about the PyConGhana 22, so I gave a follow on Twitter to find out more about what a Python Conference was all about, when I was convinced about understanding the concept of a Python conference, I promised myself to give a talk at the conference, submitted my first ever CFP and thankfully it was approved.

I understand not everyone enjoys socializing, scary but, somehow being a software developer will force you to socialize in ways that might not suit your personality, just see it as the prize you need to pay.

The decision to give my first talk at a tech conference was very crucial to my journey in landing a job, I met recruiters foreign and local, and had a couple of sincere interactions with developers who were present at the event too, I could see the gap in knowledge from my end and it challenged me that I can be better and also in the same light I could also see how far I had come as a self-taught developer seeing how much people also benefited from the little knowledge I shared at the conference.

Well, if you’re reading this I sincerely urge you to become a member of a community regardless of your level of expertise.

When you pick a language, search out for the community close to you, the Python community, for example, is very broad and diverse one, having branches in almost every continent, countries and major cities and if none is vaialable in your location, there here is a call to create one.

Being an active person in your community means you are contributing to the community from; financial contributions to resources and material, to contributing with your skills and expertise, no matter how small let your presence and impact be felt, and engage their social media handles by commenting and reposting whenever a post is made to help boost their engagments.

In the long run, when there’s a job opening, it is most times first circulated within the community before it is made public and sometimes easier for people to recommend you for a position when you’re an active member of a mutual community.

### Tip5: Market yourself:
> The price you will offer yourself to the world is how much they will buy you. ― Lailah Gifty Akita
>

What makes a story compelling, is how it is been told, to be hired for a position you want to be able to tell a story with your journey on your Twitter, Github or Linkedin profile in a way that is captivating and shows an amazing personality.

How you tell your story on these platforms is more important than your story itself, especially as one with no work experience, you should learn how to constantly share what you’re currently doing/learning, the challenges you faced and how you have overcome those challenges but, be careful not to make another boring writeup, add some personality while you market yourself.

From your display picture to your bio, be very intentional about what you post from now on, see social media as a podium and Twitter(or any other platform) as the mic, what you say and HOW you say it will determine if people should listen to you.

A story gives room for engagement, two people sharing their story on how they got a job can differ based on how they share their stories.

Why this tip might seem as tho I'm selling the importance of portraying yourself as a software engineer on social media platforms, the message I want you to pick is here is to be very deliberate about how you market yourself when telling your story.

### Tip6: Contribute to an open-source project
> Your engagement with open is the surest referral to getting your first job.
>

An open source project is a project which its source code has been made public and other developers can contribute to it, the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a good example of an open source project, my first open source project in 2022 exposed me to what a large code base looks like, as a developer it is one thing to read through your code and debug, and yet another to read and try to understand the code of others.

Contributing to an open source project will strengthen your skill in whatever language you're learning as you will be able to see thinking pieces of what makes up the code base to which you are contributing to.
Also, another benefit of contributing to open source projects as a job seeker is how it exposes you to the working wonders of a version control system when working with teams.

### Tip 7: Start applying.
> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
>

The biggest injustice you can do to yourself is to sit on the sidelines and wait for the perfect time to arrive, the right time for you to start doing what it is you want is NOW!

You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great; you don’t need to become a great “developer” before you start applying, ironically you need to start applying to become a great developer in the long run.

Polish your Linkedin profile, and prepare your resume and a cover letter.

You can start applying on Linkedin jobs or any reputable job portal, internship position or a junior position are two of the surest positions you'd most likely get if you're just starting out, and you can get these offers on Linkedin jobs depending on how you have tweaked your Linkedin page.

Besides Linkedin, another platform where you can get jobs is in the websites of the companies who are sponsoring some of these tech events, especially those who sponsor the language or framework you’re working with.

So, as a Python developer search for companies sponsoring any PyCon or DjangoCon event close to you or where you would love to work, visit the company's career pages on their website and apply to them, this process is way easier as you’re sure you already meet some of the requirements for working for the company as they are sponsors of your choiced language/framework.


### Tip 8: Believe
> To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe. - Anatole France
>

Belief is a practical instrument you need to shape reality, now you have done all the tips earlier highlighted, you must believe it can happen for you and watch it happen.

Move without fear or doubt believing it will work for you, provided you are willing to put in the work as highlighted in this article then believe it will most certainly work for you.

Thankfully November 2022 I got my offer that birthed this article <img src="{{ '/assets/images/acceptance_offer.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Acceptance offer"> I will end with a very beautiful quote from four-time grand slam singles champion, Naomi Osaka

> I don't think there's a perfectly correct path to take in life but I always felt that if you move forward with good intentions you'll find your way eventually. 
>

I know it might seem draining on some days but please don’t be discouraged, it worked for me and also it can work for you.

May the odds forever be in your favor.
