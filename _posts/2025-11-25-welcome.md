Hi there! 👋

I'm Tim Osahenru, a software engineer currently building [CodeGrades](https://www.codegrades.com/) with my friend [ntoll](https://ntoll.org/) a project-based learning platform that focuses on *doing* rather than just watching.

**We're in alpha right now** (yes, things are a bit patchy!), which means you can be part of our founding story from day one. [Come join us](https://www.codegrades.com/signup/) and help shape the future of coding education!

* **Looking to collaborate on other projects?** Reach out! I'm happy to share my CV upon request.
* **Want to connect?** You can find me over on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/timosahenru.space). While I steer clear of large, toxic social media noise, I'm always open to genuine connections there.

Can't wait to hear from you!

Tim ❤️
