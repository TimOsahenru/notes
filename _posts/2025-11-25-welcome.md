Welcome

Hi! I’m Tim Osahenru, a software engineer currently building Qanda, a distributed access management system. My work involves designing scalable microservices to optimize event data flow and validation for the TIX platform. If you're an event organizer and would love to partner with our journey. You can kindly join the waitlist so you’d be the first to inform me when we launch!

If you’d love us to collaborate on other projects, kindly reach out. I’ll be pleased to send in my CV upon request. I tend to avoid large social media gatherings that drive loud noise on false news, toxicity and what not but if you want to socialize we can catch up on my bluesky account. I can’t wait to hear from you

Tim ❤️
